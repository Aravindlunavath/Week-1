# Week-1
This project predicts water quality using machine learning based on parameters like pH, hardness, solids, sulfate, and turbidity. It classifies water as safe or unsafe, providing a fast and low-cost alternative to lab testing. Models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression were used for accurate prediction.
